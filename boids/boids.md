# Boids Challenge

Contextualize your understanding of boids by skimming Craig Reynolds boids page:

- https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/

Model the behavior of an individual boid by writing functions for each of the three steering behaviors.

(Start simply by modeling the boid as a circle so you don't have to worry about rotating the boid triangle to match the boid's heading.)

Implement a visual model that evolves flight of your flock from random initial positions.

What's the maximum number of boids your program can model?

## Bonus Features:

- Demonstrate obstacle avoidance.
- Orient the movement of your flock towards a cursor.
